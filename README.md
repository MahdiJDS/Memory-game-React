## 🧠 Game Logic Overview

- Game data stored as shuffled card objects with unique IDs.
- Click to flip: tracked using local state.
- Two flipped cards are compared — if matched, they stay flipped.
- All matches complete → show “You Win” screen.
- Reset or restart handled via state reinitialization.
